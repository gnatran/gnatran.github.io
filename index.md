## About gnatran

I am an information and business analyst specializing in public sector service transformation.

I created this small site as a way of familiarizing myself with basic GitHub functions and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). Since I often work with technical and development teams, knowing how to use one of their most popular tools will, I hope, make collaboration and communication easier on various projects.

My own background is in library science not computer science. I have a master of library and information science degree from the University of Western Ontario. I do, however, love to dabble in more technical interests - including programming, markup languages, and advanced configuration and administration of various information management tools.

My undergraduate degree is in history and philosophy, which is why you may encounter content originating from medieval and classical sources on this site.
