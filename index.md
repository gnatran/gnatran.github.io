# About this site

I created this small site as a way of familiarizing myself with basic GitHub functions and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). Since I often work with technical and development teams, knowing how to use one of their most popular tools will, I hope, make collaboration and communication easier on various projects.

I love history, which is why you may encounter content originating from medieval and classical sources on this site.
