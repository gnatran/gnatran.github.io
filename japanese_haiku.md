# A short collection of Japanese Haiku. #

*A few of my favourites recreated in markdown.*


I dreamed of battles<br>And was slain...<br>Oh savage samurai!<br>Insatiable fleas!

Dead my old fine hopes<br>and dry my dreaming<br>but still...<br>Iris, blue each spring

Hanging the lantern<br>on that full white<br>blooming bough...<br>Exquisite your care!

In the city fields<br>contemplating<br>cherry-trees...<br>Strangers are like friends

Twilight whippoorwill ...<br>whistle on,<br>sweet deepener<br>Of dark loneliness

By that fallen house<br>the pear-tree stands<br>full-blooming ...<br>An ancient battle-site

Moon so bright for love!<br>come closer, quilt...<br>enfold<br>My passionate cold!

A saddening world:<br>flowers whose sweet<br>blooms must fall...<br>As we too, alas...

Flower in the stream<br>thus too my lovely life<br>must end, another<br>Flower...<br>To fall and float away

Black desolate moor...<br>I bow before<br>the Buddha<br>Lighted in thunder

Here, where a thousand<br>captains swore grand<br>conquest ...<br>Tall grass their monument
